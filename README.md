The urban catogory is the driver of overall revenue even though it as the smallest aver fare per ride value at $24.53. This is due to the high volume of rides (1,625). This trend can be boiled down to the charatoristics of an urban enviroment many people living in a small area, traveling frequentially over short distances.

Revenues in urban areas remain higher than suburb and rural revenues throughout the entire period. Urban and Suburban areas appear to have expereienced an upward trend in revenues from January to April. Rural reveneus also apear to be heading in the same direction as Urban and Suburban areas. Yet, in April this is a substantial downturn. 

# Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
1 - Understand the rural revneu downturn in April. I reccomend surveying rural customers to understand why demand has decrease in this month. 

2 - I woud reccomend incentivizing more drivers in rural areas. It has a driver to ride ratio of over 1.6 compared to .68 for Urban areas. 

3 -Also I would reccomend incentizing more drivers in suburban areas. It has a driver to ride ratio of 1.3 compared to .68 for Urban areas. It is likely that there is latent demand.
